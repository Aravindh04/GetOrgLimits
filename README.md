# GetOrgLimits Lightning Components
Get org wide usage/limit using System.OrgLimits.getMap() then show them with progress bar.

## Usage
Put Aura Component or LWC on Lightning Page or UtilityBar.

## Included components
- Apex class: GetOrgLimits.cls
Server side controller for both aura and Lightning Web Component.
- Aura Component: orgLimits_aura
- Lightning Web Component: orgLimits_lwc

Note: Both Aura Component and LWC work as same.  You don't have to install both.

## Issues
Sometimes System.OrgLimits.getMap() failes with Insufficient Privilege.
